**THIS REPOSITORY IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.** It will soon be populated with Python code for working with the
*Austrian Highway Traffic Sign Data Set* (ATSD), e.g. for loading images and meta data, augmenting the data set, etc.
It will also contain baseline models for detecting and classifying traffic signs.

The data set itself can already be downloaded [here](https://contentportal.asfinag.at/ATSD).

If you have any inquiries, please create a GitHub issue.
